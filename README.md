# Semantic Tokens v1.0  
*A Foundational Meaning Layer for Deterministic AI Systems*

This repo hosts the Design Logic specification and research artifacts for **Semantic Tokens (STs)** — a governed, typed meaning layer that stabilizes intent, structure, and relational semantics across tools, agents, and models.

## Abstract (short)

Modern AI systems rely on surface-form text tokens that blend meaning with raw language, producing drift, ambiguity, and instability in long-context reasoning. Semantic Tokens (STs) introduce a governed, typed, meaning-level representation that preserves intent, structure, and relational semantics independently of text. This work defines the ST standard, formalizes the token schema and execution model, and shows how STs enable deterministic reasoning, multi-agent coordination, and safer orchestration at scale.
